# split-files
This program takes a file (for eg. image file, video) and splits the file so that file has different sections which can be transferred by different mediums and then stitched back together after all the sections are placed together.
The steps for how this program works is.
1. The user chooses which file they want to split.
2. The program reads the file and writes it in a .txt file.
3. The user is prompted how many sections they want to split the file into.
4. After the file is split, there are individual .txt which contain the split data.
5. The hash is calculated for each split file.
6. After this the process is reversed and the original file is obtained. 

<b> Please do not delete the binary.txt and hash.txt file. If you transferring the split files even these two files binary.txt and hash.txt have to be transfered. </b>
